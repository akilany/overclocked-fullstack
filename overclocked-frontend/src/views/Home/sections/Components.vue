                <p>Building your own computer is the answer. Not only do you have complete control over which components
                    you choose, you also get to peer under the hood and see what makes a PC run.</p>

                    <h2>CPU</h2>
                    <p>Your central processing unit, or CPU, is often referred to as the computer’s brain. It controls
                        the number of tasks your computer can accomplish at once and how quickly it can complete said
                        tasks.</p>

                    <h2>GPU</h2>
                    <p>The graphics processing unit, also known as the GPU, graphics card, or video card, is a pretty
                        flashy component. Not only does it look cool, but it makes your games appear photorealistic
                        without crashing your computer or slowing your gameplay.

                    <h2>RAM</h2>
                    <p>While many of us struggle to think of what we ate for lunch yesterday, computers equipped with
                        the right memory sticks have rock-solid short-term memories. Random access memory, or RAM,
                        allows computers to access files quickly and run multiple processes at once without lagging.

                    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
                    <p>The motherboard houses the various components of your PC. Like a flesh-and-blood mother, it takes
                        the disparate pieces, sits them down in their proper places, and helps them behave well
                        together.

                    <h2>HDD</h2>
                    <p>A hard disk is actually a set of stacked disks, like phonograph records. It comes with a large
                        storage capacity but it is not really fast, it's cheap. It's provides relatively quick access to
                        large amounts of data
                    </p>

                    <h2>PSU</h2>
                    <p>You’re going to need to harness the power of electricity to bring your PC to life. This is where
                        a quality power supply unit, or PSU, comes into play.
